The code is a parallel, interface-resolved CFD solver for multicomponent droplet evaporation, based on the Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method with MTHINC reconstruction. It solves the incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations using a staggered finite-difference grid and an FFT-based pressure solver. Species transport in the gas uses Dirichlet conditions, while the liquid side uses a Robin boundary condition, handled via extrapolation and PDE-based ghost value reconstruction. The interface velocity is built from a divergence-free extension of the liquid flow and a Stefan correction, enabling accurate phase change modeling in turbulent, multi-species two-phase flows.
